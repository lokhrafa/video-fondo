# FullScreen Video Background
FullScreen Video Background using HTML &amp; CSS
In this repository, I've created 3 files. The first is a basic video background, In the second one, I've added some user interaction in it and In the third file I've included a YouTube video as a background video. All of them are responsive. I've mentioned some additional stuff when trying to made a video in the background responsive. Additionally I've mentioned some basic YouTube customization while trying to embed a YouTube Video in the background. 

## Type1: The basic FullScreen Video Background
This is the basic fullscreen video background that's mostly included in the header of a webpage. I've included some basic heading, description and a button. I've also included an overlay above the video background.

## Type2: The FullScreen Video Background with User interaction
This is the almost similar to the first one, except that the video background can be paused/played by the user. The user can control this. This type is mostly used if we want to describe the video and want the user to control it.

## Type3: The YouTube video Background
This is about including a YouYube video in the background. Suprisingly, its very simple. Add few customization and make it as a background. Although, YouTube does not allow the branding name to be removed completely.
